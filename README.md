# CIFAR
A CIFAR-10 image classification system built with Python and TensorFlow, utilizing deep and wide-and-deep neural networks to classify images into 10 categories. The project preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset, performs hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner, and evaluates models using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
